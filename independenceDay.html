        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Independence Day in the Philippines, observed on June 12, is a national holiday marked by parades, with a main event in Manila featuring a police and military parade led by the president, a speech, and a 21-gun salute. Government offices and schools are closed, though shopping centers remain open. Public transport is available but may be limited due to parade routes. The holiday commemorates the Declaration of Independence from Spain on June 12, 1898, by General Emilio Aguinaldo, though full sovereignty was only achieved on July 4, 1946, after the U.S. relinquished control. Initially celebrated on July 4, the holiday was moved to June 12 in 1964 under Republic Act No. 4166.
