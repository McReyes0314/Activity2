        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            National Heroes Day in the Philippines is observed on the last Monday of August each year to honor the courageous heroes, both known and unknown, who fought for the nation's freedom from colonial powers like Spain, the U.S., and Japan. This public holiday is marked by parades, ceremonies at historic sites, and fireworks. Established by the Philippine Legislature in 1931, it stands as one of the Philippines' oldest national holidays, originating during the American occupation. National Heroes Day is a significant cultural observance that commemorates those who contributed to the foundation of the countryâ€™s national identity and independence.
