        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Rizal Day is a national holiday in the Philippines celebrated every December 30 to honor the life and works of Jos√© Rizal, a national hero. This date marks the anniversary of Rizal's execution in 1896 at Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park) in Manila. The holiday was first established on December 20, 1898, by President Emilio Aguinaldo, who declared December 30, 1898, a day of mourning for Rizal and others who suffered under Spanish colonial rule. Daet in Camarines Norte built the first Rizal monument in 1899 to honor him. Following the American takeover, Governor-General William Howard Taft recognized Rizal as a national hero, and in 1902, the Philippine Commission declared December 30 a public holiday.</p>
